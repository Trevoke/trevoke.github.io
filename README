Personal site of Aldric Giacomoni, managed by emacs, org mode, git and org-page.

Remember:

1. The `source` directory is where the org files go
2. The `master` directory is where the compiled HTML goes
3. the `wip` directory in `master` is only there because, well, there's currently no clean way to have a draft in the `source` directory.
