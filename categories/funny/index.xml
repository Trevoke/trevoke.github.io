      <description>Let&amp;#39;s break the monotony with something funny:  The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent terrorist threats and have raised their security level from Miffed to Peeved&amp;#34; Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to Irritated or even A Bit Cross. The English have not been A Bit Cross since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies all but ran out.  Terrorists have been re-categorized from Tiresome to a Bloody Nuisance&amp;#34; The last time the British issued a Bloody Nuisance warning level was in 1588 when threatened by the Spanish Armada.</description>
