      <description>What this entry is and is not about   This entry talks about estimates in a relatively perfect world. This entry does not talk about problems that teams run into when dealing with estimates in a world where estimates are often misunderstood and where parties try to pile up additional meanings and metrics to estimates. Why talk about estimating at all   Estimating work to be done before it is done.</description>

      <description>Shu Ha Ri comes from the world of Japanese Noh theater, and has been since attached to the world of martial arts and &amp;lt;a title=&amp;#34;Alistair Cockburn&amp;#39;s words on Shu Ha Ri&amp;#34; href=&amp;#34;http://alistair.cockburn.us/Shu+Ha+Ri&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Agile development&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Roughly, &amp;#34;shu ha ri&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;learn / detach / transcend&amp;#34;. The link has some words about that meaning. I&amp;#39;d like to talk about my particular take on Shu Ha Ri, which came out of a parking-lot conversation with a martial arts teacher friend of mine:  &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shu.</description>

      <description>The Art of Agile Planning (#aoap on Twitter, and AOAP from now on) is a 2-day course. The focus is on understanding the higher-level constructs of Agile and how they imbricate. In the course, one learns how the ideal Agile team is composed (hint: it&amp;#39;s cross-functional and co-located) and what practices and techniques will be used to organize at all levels, from the developers&amp;#39; standup to the customers&amp;#39; research for the next best value-delivering feature, including how to properly create a feature that developers can work on and how to best break it down into stories (and then into tasks).</description>
