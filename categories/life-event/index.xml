      <description>On Monday, April 26th, I am starting a new job at Cyrus Innovation. It may well be fair that I am starting a new career - it&#39;s a hop, skip and jump for me. I&#39;m switching from Systems Administration / Tech Support / Hell desk (not a typo, sadly) to Development / Programming.
I am very much looking forward to it. It means a hobby/job switch: I will now do sysadmin stuff as a hobby, and programming as a full-time job.</description>

      <description>On February 28th, 2010, I took the test to become a second-degree black belt.
Here is a summary of what I had to do, besides the calisthenics:
 All my empty-hand forms, opposite side. There are eight of them. This meant that if the first step was with the left foot, I had to do it with the right foot. I suppose you could also call that &#39;mirror&#39;. The names are : seisan, seiuchin, naihanchi, wonsu, chinto, kusanku, sunsu, and sanchin.</description>
