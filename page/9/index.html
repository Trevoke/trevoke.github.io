      <div class="content">
        Yesterday we had a small class, so we were able to each work on what we needed. I, hopefully, now have the full chatan yara no sai form, so I just need to work it..
We did some kali stick work. The yellow and blue belt had never seen those drills before so we started with a simple high-low-high, but we did try for a little bit the sinawali drills, specifically heaven, because that one's fun :) Kali sticks are very good to work follow-through, speed and flow, and god knows I need that.

      <div class="content">
        Monday and yesterday, two blue belts were to test for purple. They went through their calisthenics and basics; I did not see their forms on Monday, but I did see them on Wednesday. They were bad enough sensei wanted to see them again, that much I understood, but not sure how bad until I saw them both.
Neither of them broke a sweat until fighting, not for the 100 jumping jacks, not for the 60 push-ups, not for the multiple kick combinations.

      <div class="content">
        Is it a worrying trend that I write mostly about pain in here? :)
Every once in a while, usually while doing a high block with my left arm, I'd feel a pain in my left shoulder. It felt like a part was rolling over another one.. Muscle over bone, or something like that. It's not pleasant and is the kind of pain that stops your movement quite short and quite abruptly.

      <div class="content">
        I don't know how I did it, but at some point during my empty hand class, I hurt my back. Think of a line going horizontally across the middle of the back (under the shoulderblades), and you have it. I didn't stay for weapons past my bo class and went home. I was OK during my sword class, which means either I wasn't paying attention, or I wasn't using those muscles.

      <div class="content">
        We have a move in a form that requires holding a hand in front of the solar plexus. One of the kids was holding his hand a little low, so I mentioned it to him.. He start hitting his chest a few times with his hand, so I laugh. "Think you got it?" He does it a few more times and starts coughing. "Ah, now you got it."

      <div class="content">
        Sparring can be one of the many reasons one wants to join a martial arts school, sometimes even their only interest. Unless you join a school based on street defense, you may not do as much as you'd like. Besides, the insurances and legality issues being what they are, usually you are limited to sparring gear which lets you mostly throw punches and kicks.
The teacher of a traditional school probably won't let you spar until after you get a belt or two, because you need to break in your body and the techniques you are learning -- besides, you don't have enough control to know when to stop your strikes, so if your opponent fails to block, you could hurt him quite a bit.

      <div class="content">
        So, you've decided to start taking a martial arts class. Good for you!
Why do you want to join? Is it to fight, to learn to defend yourself, to develop self-discipline, to learn kata ('forms'), for health reasons? All of the above?
For the purpose of this article (if nothing else), I will make a differentiation between a fighting style and a martial art. In a fighting style, you are learning to fight, and that is it.
