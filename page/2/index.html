      <div class="content">
        So, the litany against fear goes like this:
&nbsp; I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. &nbsp;

      <div class="content">
        I'm back from Rubyconf.
Some people say Ruby is dead. We can probably gloss over Zed Shaw's famous rant, since it's from roundabout 2007. My understanding is that the thought came about because of the many new trends in programming languages: first node, then Erlang's comeback and the birth of Elixir. Evented programming, non-blocking IO, all the fancy buzzwords, and everyone craps on Ruby's Global Interpreter Lock.
Given the talks at Rubyconf, Ruby is most likely not dead (and our internal rubylist has an ongoing recent conversation about this if you're curious).

      <div class="content">
        The first class went really well.
My teaching tempo is still pretty good, though I did underestimate how much information I was giving the new students. Next time, I need to make sure I don't overwhelm them, and keep them to a smaller set of basics.
This feels right. I know it's what I'm going to keep doing. Now I need to balance continued growth with proper teaching time. If I can do this twice a week, I'll have a good next step.

      <div class="content">
        What Sparring Is Sparring is a playful and explorative interaction.
Sparring is an exercise, a drill. The Japanese use the word KUMITE - which basically means "grouped hands" or "pair hands", "joined hands", "hands together" (the Wikipedia article suggests "grappling hands").
Sparring is a two-person free-form exercise wherein you get to examine scenarios involving combinations, footwork, distancing, rhythm, controlled power, and focus to improve yourself and your partner.

Combinations: you get to play first-hand with things you have learned and put them in an environment where there is no set response.

      <div class="content">
        In the dojo where I spent my formative years as a martial artist, there is a school creed. A quick search online has revealed that many schools have a similar creed. Every class says it as we begin, after bowing in, before calisthenics. I hear it and/or say it about three times per dojo night.
It's a simple creed, and clearly not unique. Here's what it says: I intend to develop myself in a positive manner and avoid anything that would reduce my mental growth or physical health.

      <div class="content">
        More to the point, should Rails die?
Rails brought a lot of great things - it made it dumb easy to package an entire app together. It abstracted the complexity of the storage layer. It created an entire market. Things like Heroku, Railsonfire/codeship and other companies turned a profit by extending the benefits of Rails. And things like Capistrano were born.
Everything that can be automated should be automated.

        I had an epiphany tonight about something that just about everyone knows: the three monkeys. And I wanted to share it with you.
The three monkeys are accompanied by the words: "See no evil. Hear no evil. Speak no evil." The funny thing is that one monkey is covering his eyes, one monkey is covering his ears, and one monkey is covering his mouth! Let's examine that for a second.
