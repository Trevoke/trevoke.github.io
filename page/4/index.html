      <div class="content">
        First, get Ruby. Install it as explained on the website. Once you're more comfortable with it, in a few weeks, you can check out RVM. Not now though - you'd just confuse yourself.
The two important command-line tools are going to be "irb" and "ruby". For development, you will be able to use tools like emacs, vim, Jetbrains Rubymine, or Eclipse. Ruby support is quite widespread.
Create a temporary directory and get cozy inside.

        The Master had been clear on this point - the room was treated so the five physical senses would be useless. When Scott asked how, the Master laughed and told him it was magic. Scott had chuckled and shaken his head. Clearly, no point in arguing - not today's knowledge.
Scott blinked and the test began. He relaxed and extended his consciousness into the ground below him and around him. He knew his limit well: no more than a five-foot radius around him.

        If you happen to use Gentoo on a Notebook, you may already know this. If not..
At the time of this writing, If you have a Poulsbo video card (another craptastic Intel invention) do not upgrade to xorg-server 1.7. Stay on 1.6.5-r1 or whatever you have. If you upgrade, xorg will just refuse to work for you, and downgrading is kind of a pain.
If you have upgraded already, then here's what to do:

        Sensei helped me figure out that my punches are all wrong, and the issue has been traced to lower back muscles. Thankfully, I've got tons of subway time now, so I can practice standing. For those of you who don't study martial arts... That last sentence is not a joke.

      <div class="content">
        On Monday, April 26th, I am starting a new job at Cyrus Innovation. It may well be fair that I am starting a new career - it's a hop, skip and jump for me. I'm switching from Systems Administration / Tech Support / Hell desk (not a typo, sadly) to Development / Programming.
I am very much looking forward to it. It means a hobby/job switch: I will now do sysadmin stuff as a hobby, and programming as a full-time job.

        Hooks are a fascinating bit of Ruby magic. They are methods you can define with actions to run when something happens. You can put triggers in your code.
This blog post explains them very well; and for more information, get "Metaprogramming Ruby", which is a great book - not only about the callbacks, but about a host of information.

        On February 28th, 2010, I took the test to become a second-degree black belt.
Here is a summary of what I had to do, besides the calisthenics:  All my empty-hand forms, opposite side. There are eight of them. This meant that if the first step was with the left foot, I had to do it with the right foot. I suppose you could also call that 'mirror'. The names are : seisan, seiuchin, naihanchi, wonsu, chinto, kusanku, sunsu, and sanchin.

      <div class="content">
        I will readily admit that I don't know all that much about Github or Git for that matter. I use them, they're handy, and that's where it stops. I read about a git feature called "smart HTTP", which would allow to communicate both ways with git (push and pull) with HTTP or HTTPS. So, I asked Github about it - it would be nice for them to have this feature, because I currently can't push to Github from work.

        Last night, after some kicking drills and sparring, sensei entrusted the adult class to me and told us to work on kusanku. The 'adult class' yesterday consisted of three sankyu. I looked at the clock, rubbed my hands together and said "Alright everyone, we have twenty-five minutes' worth of kusanku. Let me know if you have questions or doubts." When we had finished walking through it, I looked at the clock.

        There are a few gotchas: 1) If you have a SSD drive, you need to modprobe pata_sch to see it. 2) when using GRUB, install it on whatever drive the hard drive is, even if it's /dev/sdc -- and let your FSTAB use /dev/sda. Chances are that /dev/sda is your liveUSB. 3) In the kernel, in the I2C options, don't let it pick automatically - instead, select the algorithm options in the menu that appears (I don't know it off-hand, will edit this post later to add the important information).
