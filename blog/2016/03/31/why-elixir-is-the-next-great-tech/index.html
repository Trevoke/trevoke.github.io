<h1>Why Elixir is the next Great Tech</h1>

<p>
I think of it has an idea whose time has come - or rather, a great gathering of ideas.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Erlang has solved the problem of distributed computing (and therefore, of concurrency) decades ago, and now concurrency is a very desirable tool, as the amount of data we crunch regularly has increased exponentially.</li>
<li>TDD has brought a more functional approach to a lot of people's code, and that is the paradigm Elixir espouses.</li>
<li>Elixir takes all of the syntax niceness from Ruby, so it's pretty and easy to read.</li>
<li>Elixir makes OTP incredibly convenient to use, which means creating a new process, keeping track of it, and communicating with it, and each maybe one line of code, instead of the the ridiculous amount of code you'd need in other languages.</li>
<li>Elixir's Phoenix Framework makes both stateless (traditional request/response) and stateful (anything from long-polling to websockets) connections very simple to use, by providing very powerful abstractions based on OTP. The code remains readable.</li>
<li>Elixir's Phoenix Framework takes from all the lessons of Rails and Javascript of the past decade and has created a testable, maintainable, extendable web MVC framework that is in actuality just another OTP application</li>
<li>As we depend more and more on external services (API, whether internal or external), fault tolerance becomes top-of-mind when building robust systems. This is another problem Erlang has solved years ago, through supervisors and choosing how to handle crashes.</li>
<li>Elixir/OTP allows for crazy uptime by letting you write code in such a way that you can actually do hot reloading.</li>
<li>Elixir implements real macros, one of the very few non-lisp languages to do so, and does so fairly cleanly. This allows you to, should you need it, create your own domain language in your code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As we move more towards microservices, and given that a microservice is the unit of thought in Elixir (an OTP app is just a service that can receive messages, send messages, and hold state), it will become a de-facto choice, because it is a superior abstraction to the existing choices.
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned above, it lets you create websocket connections very easily, maintaining a single state via the socket, which is also a rather tempting idea for folks using the Flux architecture in the front-end.
