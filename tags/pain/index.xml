      <description>So tonight, I went to train 35 minutes away from home, at the dojo where my sensei&amp;#39;s sensei teaches. Warmups / stretches, kicking drills, calisthenics, sparring, then fighting drills. Sensei&amp;#39;s sensei has a son who is now 48. Now â€“ I am fast by normal people&amp;#39;s standards. This guy is really fast by my standards. He also has a really positive energy - very friendly eyes, a great disposition.. And he can dislocate your jaw before you can blink or think &amp;#34;oh sh.</description>

      <description>Is it a worrying trend that I write mostly about pain in here? :)  Every once in a while, usually while doing a high block with my left arm, I&amp;#39;d feel a pain in my left shoulder. It felt like a part was rolling over another one.. Muscle over bone, or something like that. It&amp;#39;s not pleasant and is the kind of pain that stops your movement quite short and quite abruptly.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#39;t know how I did it, but at some point during my empty hand class, I hurt my back. Think of a line going horizontally across the middle of the back (under the shoulderblades), and you have it. I didn&amp;#39;t stay for weapons past my bo class and went home. I was OK during my sword class, which means either I wasn&amp;#39;t paying attention, or I wasn&amp;#39;t using those muscles.</description>
