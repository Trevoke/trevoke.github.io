      <description>This song is at least as old as 1973 and is originally from Italy (Giorgio Gaber - Dente della conoscenza). If you like finding patterns, making analogies and metaphors, and overall pondering, then examine the tooth of knowledge in the contexts of: science, religion, culture, society (etiquette, etc), and finally, the internet.

      <description>Here is a thought with which I&#39;ve been wrestling for quite a while - the focus of society on knowledge and what it could be doing to us as people, human beings, and members of society, as well as to society itself.
Knowledge is power - knowing more can only help you In the West (bounded to the east by Russia and to the west by the Americas), the focus has historically been on developing more knowledge, more science.</description>
