      <description>Here is a thought with which I&#39;ve been wrestling for quite a while - the focus of society on knowledge and what it could be doing to us as people, human beings, and members of society, as well as to society itself.
Knowledge is power - knowing more can only help you In the West (bounded to the east by Russia and to the west by the Americas), the focus has historically been on developing more knowledge, more science.</description>

      <description>Those two videos have been brought to my attention within maybe two weeks of each other, and I hate thinking of random coincidences.. So here they are, together so I can find them again in several years.

The first one fills my heart with a warm feeling - the song was recorded by all these people around the world simultaneously (or so they say, but it sure is well edited in any case).</description>
