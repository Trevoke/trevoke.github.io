      <description>On February 28th, 2010, I took the test to become a second-degree black belt.
Here is a summary of what I had to do, besides the calisthenics:  All my empty-hand forms, opposite side. There are eight of them. This meant that if the first step was with the left foot, I had to do it with the right foot. I suppose you could also call that &#39;mirror&#39;. The names are : seisan, seiuchin, naihanchi, wonsu, chinto, kusanku, sunsu, and sanchin.</description>

      <description>Well, sensei hinted last month that maybe I should start gearing up for a nidan test. I&#39;ve been getting used to being shodan, which maybe is a bad thing, but I haven&#39;t stopped looking for things I could do better. I&#39;m becoming more sensitive to the muscles in my back, and I think my shoulders are finally beginning to open up...
So, I have something like 5 months to prepare.. Or, you know, whenever it turns out sensei thinks I&#39;m ready.</description>
