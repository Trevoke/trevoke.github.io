      <description>Yesterday we had a small class, so we were able to each work on what we needed. I, hopefully, now have the full chatan yara no sai form, so I just need to work it..  We did some kali stick work. The yellow and blue belt had never seen those drills before so we started with a simple high-low-high, but we did try for a little bit the sinawali drills, specifically heaven, because that one&amp;#39;s fun :) Kali sticks are very good to work follow-through, speed and flow, and god knows I need that.</description>
