      <description>Yesterday evening a man who trained about as long as sensei came to train with us. Black obi, rather frayed to white. He&amp;#39;d trained a long time under his uncle, and then ~15 years under sensei&amp;#39;s sensei. He&amp;#39;d taken a break for a while, so he was a bit out of shape, but his mindset, his attitude, his devotion were 100% into everything he did - an important lesson which I forget all too often.</description>
