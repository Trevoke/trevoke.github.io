      <description>So, the litany against fear goes like this:  &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</description>

      <description>In the dojo where I spent my formative years as a martial artist, there is a school creed. A quick search online has revealed that many schools have a similar creed. Every class says it as we begin, after bowing in, before calisthenics. I hear it and/or say it about three times per dojo night.  It&amp;#39;s a simple creed, and clearly not unique. Here&amp;#39;s what it says:  &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;I intend to develop myself in a positive manner and avoid anything that would reduce my mental growth or physical health.</description>
