      <description>The first class went really well.
My teaching tempo is still pretty good, though I did underestimate how much information I was giving the new students. Next time, I need to make sure I don&#39;t overwhelm them, and keep them to a smaller set of basics.
This feels right. I know it&#39;s what I&#39;m going to keep doing. Now I need to balance continued growth with proper teaching time. If I can do this twice a week, I&#39;ll have a good next step.</description>

      <description>I had a good time in the dojo tonight. Managed to bring a kid back from the verge of tears to feeling good and performing kata with solid focus and intent.. And then good sparring. Kid&#39;s 6, by the way. My class wasn&#39;t that good, though I got a compliment on my push-ups from sensei. Went through my kicks.. Then sparred..
I fleetingly get a grasp of efficient body movement, and then it disappears, and then I have to train a lot more to make it happen again, and then more again, etc etc, until I can make it happen effortlessly.</description>
