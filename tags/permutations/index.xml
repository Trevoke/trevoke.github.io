      <description>I don&#39;t really have a better name for this. It&#39;s also not completely clean, but it works. I had, almost a year ago (362 days ago), written a blog post about lexicographic permutations. That was about permutations of elements within one array. Someone on ruby-forum asked about permutations between multiple arrays. I found something in C#, which I was happy to transcribe to Ruby and tweak a little.

      <description>Look, Ma, these are my baby steps in algorithms!

      <description>Taking the code from this other blog ... It&#39;s pretty elegant Ruby!
I won&#39;t waste your time repeating what the guy wrote in his blog - you&#39;re welcome to go read it. I just felt that I should help spread a little this elegant implementation of the standard permutation algorithm, fixing a small bug within it in the process. If, like me, you have issues understanding how to use this, well - you have to use this function and call a block of code on it.</description>
