      <description>On February 28th, 2010, I took the test to become a second-degree black belt.  Here is a summary of what I had to do, besides the calisthenics:  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;All my empty-hand forms, opposite side. There are eight of them. This meant that if the first step was with the left foot, I had to do it with the right foot. I suppose you could also call that &amp;#39;mirror&amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to keep my stances down a lot more now - it&amp;#39;s making me much more aware of when I get tense.. Because I rise, because my ankles, hips and knees just don&amp;#39;t flex. It&amp;#39;s an interesting experience. Two people are testing.. During sparring, that evening was the first time that I made a conscious point of &amp;#34;the first thing I do is move - and then answer&amp;#34;.</description>

      <description>Well, sensei hinted last month that maybe I should start gearing up for a nidan test. I&amp;#39;ve been getting used to being shodan, which maybe is a bad thing, but I haven&amp;#39;t stopped looking for things I could do better. I&amp;#39;m becoming more sensitive to the muscles in my back, and I think my shoulders are finally beginning to open upâ€¦  So, I have something like 5 months to prepare.</description>

      <description> This week two more students tested. We have a new green belt and a new blue belt. They did pretty well, but I am completely amazed at how many excuses adults have. Their heads are full of them. Can&amp;#39;t they just listen and say &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; like they were taught when they were kids? Talking back is a privilege, not a right. Ooh.. That&amp;#39;s good.. I&amp;#39;ll reuse that. </description>

      <title>Testing for purple</title>

      <description>Monday and yesterday, two blue belts were to test for purple. They went through their calisthenics and basics; I did not see their forms on Monday, but I did see them on Wednesday. They were bad enough sensei wanted to see them again, that much I understood, but not sure how bad until I saw them both.  Neither of them broke a sweat until fighting, not for the 100 jumping jacks, not for the 60 push-ups, not for the multiple kick combinations.</description>
