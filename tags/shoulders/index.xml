      <description>A friend of mine wrote about shoulder relaxation.. Apparently we both had the same mental block, but he solved it first - shoulder relaxation (and by extension, all relaxation) can be done up/down and â€¦ forward/back!  At first I didn&amp;#39;t think I had that issue, my western mind automatically went &amp;#34;Nah, I don&amp;#39;t have that issue, my shoulders are nice and straight!&amp;#34; .. And then training kicked in and the answer came : &amp;#34;Well, maybe they&amp;#39;re not supposed to be straight!</description>
