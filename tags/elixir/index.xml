      <description>GenStage is a miracle of UX for developers. There&amp;#39;s only one catch: because of its purpose, it&amp;#39;s built for the machine, not for the developer. Let&amp;#39;s go over what GenStage is for, and see just how simple it is to start using it. Why would you use GenStage?   GenStage is what you would use if you had &amp;#34;some work&amp;#34; (events) that needed to go through one or more transformations, which you could easily split into multiple parallelizable steps.</description>

      <description>Elixir, because:   I think of Elixir as an idea whose time has come; or rather, a great gathering of ideas.    Erlang has solved the problem of distributed computing (and therefore, of concurrency) decades ago, and now concurrency is a very desirable tool, as the amount of data we crunch regularly has increased exponentially.    TDD has brought a more functional approach to a lot code, and that is the paradigm Elixir espouses.</description>
