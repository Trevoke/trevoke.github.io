      <description>Choosing the right editor
Intro: My editor history
Here are my &#34;credentials&#34;. You know, establishing why you should be reading this at all.
When it comes to editors, I&#39;ve honestly fumbled around quite a bit in the past fifteen years or so. I had not encountered an editor until some dude taught my Comp Sci 6/9 class and straight-up went to the GNU webpage and downloaded emacs for Windows. That looked really badass.</description>

      <title>The first step in learning any new programming language</title>
      <link>http://blog.trevoke.net/post/learn-a-new-prog/</link>

      <description>Part of being a professional programmer is learning new languages (seriously — past a certain point, you should be fluent in a couple of languages, but that&#39;s another blog post), and part of being a good programmer is being effective at doing so. The very first step in learning a new language is being able to write some code with it. Further steps usually involve mastering the syntax as well as whatever new paradigms the language may throw at you, BUT!</description>

      <description>I just found a great example of the variability of the need of creating maintainable code.
Somewhere around 2006, I created a script that posts to the Livejournal community daily_tao a new chapter of the Tao Te Ching every day. Today in 2016, I had a need to look for the script, the second time in maybe the last eight years that I had to look at it.
I temporarily wasn&#39;t sure of where that script was.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.trevoke.net/post/benefits-of-a-rapid-test-suite/</guid>
      <description>The value of a rapid test suite Developers and codebases The bare minimum required of a developer is &#34;make this change without breaking anything else in the code&#34;, and if you&#39;ve been around software development for any period of time, you know that&#39;s harder than it seems.
Most of the time that a developer spends on any given codebase is spent on an existing codebase, adding new features on top of existing code.</description>

      <title>      Why Elixir is the next Great Tech</title>
      <link>http://blog.trevoke.net/post/elixir/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.trevoke.net/post/elixir/</guid>
      <description>Elixir, because:  I think of Elixir as an idea whose time has come; or rather, a great gathering of ideas. Erlang has solved the problem of distributed computing (and therefore, of concurrency) decades ago, and now concurrency is a very desirable tool, as the amount of data we crunch regularly has increased exponentially. TDD has brought a more functional approach to a lot code, and that is the paradigm Elixir espouses.</description>

      <title>      The value of estimates for a team</title>

      <guid>http://blog.trevoke.net/post/the-value-of-estimates-for-a-team/</guid>
      <description>What this entry is and is not about This entry talks about estimates in a relatively perfect world. This entry does not talk about problems that teams run into when dealing with estimates in a world where estimates are often misunderstood and where parties try to pile up additional meanings and metrics to estimates.
Why talk about estimating at all Estimating work to be done before it is done. Great if you know what the work is.</description>

      <title>The code showed that I understood a wall existed</title>

      <description>Someone I worked with once said, &#34;The code didn&#39;t demonstrate that I hit a wall, just that I understood a wall existed.&#34;
This colleague had been using the technique of Test-Driven Design (TDD) to methodically get the codebase up to a point where it could be refactorable and, at the same time, to a point where a problem with the current design decisions could surface. He was happy because now that he was up to that point, the future decisions for the refactors were much more clear.</description>

      <description>Spreadsheets Spreadsheets are evil. And do you know why? Because they&#39;re too powerful. Here is the sweet spot of spreadsheets: tables of related data on which calculations need to be made. Here is not the sweet spot of spreadsheets: everything else.
Single Responsibility Principle Spreadsheet software is so powerful nowadays that you can make visualizations for almost anything. And some people are happy to spend a really long time creating and maintaing those, but I am WAY, WAY lazier than those people are.</description>

      <description>Shu Ha Ri comes from the world of Japanese Noh theater, and has been since attached to the world of martial arts and Agile development. Roughly, &#34;shu ha ri&#34; means &#34;learn / detach / transcend&#34;. The link has some words about that meaning. I&#39;d like to talk about my particular take on Shu Ha Ri, which came out of a parking-lot conversation with a martial arts teacher friend of mine:  Shu.</description>

      <description>“Life is going to present to you a series of transformations. And the point of education should be to transform you. To teach you how to be transformed so you can ride the waves as they come. But today, the point of education is not education. It’s accreditation. The more accreditation you have, the more money you make. That’s the instrumental logic of neoliberalism. And this instrumental logic comes wrapped in an envelope of fear.</description>

      <title>The Litany Against Fear</title>

      <guid>http://blog.trevoke.net/post/import-the-litany-against-fear-publish/</guid>
      <description>So, the litany against fear goes like this:
&amp;nbsp; I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>I&#39;m back from Rubyconf.
Some people say Ruby is dead. We can probably gloss over Zed Shaw&#39;s famous rant, since it&#39;s from roundabout 2007. My understanding is that the thought came about because of the many new trends in programming languages: first node, then Erlang&#39;s comeback and the birth of Elixir. Evented programming, non-blocking IO, all the fancy buzzwords, and everyone craps on Ruby&#39;s Global Interpreter Lock.
Given the talks at Rubyconf, Ruby is most likely not dead (and our internal rubylist has an ongoing recent conversation about this if you&#39;re curious).</description>

      <description>The first class went really well.
My teaching tempo is still pretty good, though I did underestimate how much information I was giving the new students. Next time, I need to make sure I don&#39;t overwhelm them, and keep them to a smaller set of basics.
This feels right. I know it&#39;s what I&#39;m going to keep doing. Now I need to balance continued growth with proper teaching time. If I can do this twice a week, I&#39;ll have a good next step.</description>

      <description>What Sparring Is Sparring is a playful and explorative interaction.
Sparring is an exercise, a drill. The Japanese use the word KUMITE - which basically means &#34;grouped hands&#34; or &#34;pair hands&#34;, &#34;joined hands&#34;, &#34;hands together&#34; (the Wikipedia article suggests &#34;grappling hands&#34;).
Sparring is a two-person free-form exercise wherein you get to examine scenarios involving combinations, footwork, distancing, rhythm, controlled power, and focus to improve yourself and your partner.

Combinations: you get to play first-hand with things you have learned and put them in an environment where there is no set response.</description>

      <description>In the dojo where I spent my formative years as a martial artist, there is a school creed. A quick search online has revealed that many schools have a similar creed. Every class says it as we begin, after bowing in, before calisthenics. I hear it and/or say it about three times per dojo night.
It&#39;s a simple creed, and clearly not unique. Here&#39;s what it says: I intend to develop myself in a positive manner and avoid anything that would reduce my mental growth or physical health.</description>

      <title>Is Rails dying?</title>

      <description>More to the point, should Rails die?
Rails brought a lot of great things - it made it dumb easy to package an entire app together. It abstracted the complexity of the storage layer. It created an entire market. Things like Heroku, Railsonfire/codeship and other companies turned a profit by extending the benefits of Rails. And things like Capistrano were born.
Everything that can be automated should be automated.

      <description>No object should have more than three public methods Objects should not have getters or setters Everything else must be private If three private methods are doing something similar, then maybe those are the public methods of another class Never inherit Always compose Changeability is the most important thing A &#34;good&#34; variable name is a name that describes unambiguously what the variable contains, without describing the implementation If you don’t use good variable names, I will look for you.</description>

The three monkeys are accompanied by the words: &#34;See no evil. Hear no evil. Speak no evil.&#34; The funny thing is that one monkey is covering his eyes, one monkey is covering his ears, and one monkey is covering his mouth! Let&#39;s examine that for a second.</description>

      <description>You&#39;re training wrong! No, YOU&#39;re training wrong! A recent set of conversations have led me to examine the major difference in martial training. I&#39;m going to start by separating training in two categories, making an imperfect black-and-white model of the martial world:  Traditional eastern training Jeet Kune Do-like training  Now, let&#39;s start to talk about the PURPOSE of each, in a fairly roundabout way.
Let&#39;s talk about the traditional drill which has become sort of a standard: &#34;</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re using Devise and rspec on Rails 3, and you want to override a controller, and you end up with an error that makes no sense whatsoever:
&#34;Undefined method &#39;name&#39; for nil:NilClass&#34;, well then, you probably want to add the following line to your tests:
@request.env[&amp;quot;devise.mapping&amp;quot;] = Devise.mappings[:admin]  Yeah... That took me way longer than expected.
On a COMPLETELY UNRELATED SIDE NOTE, pry is pretty cool when you end up having to step through code.</description>

      <description>This song is at least as old as 1973 and is originally from Italy (Giorgio Gaber - Dente della conoscenza). If you like finding patterns, making analogies and metaphors, and overall pondering, then examine the tooth of knowledge in the contexts of: science, religion, culture, society (etiquette, etc), and finally, the internet.

(note : &#39;SHHH&#39; is an inhaling sound)

      <description>Ruby has a neat feature called at_exit which takes a block and then executes the contents of this block when the program ends. There are a couple of VERY important details:  It takes a block and converts it into a Proc object at the time of parsing. This means that the data has to be available in the binding, or you&#39;ll run into errors. Example: instance variables need to be set before you can use them in that block.</description>

      <description>The Art of Agile Planning (#aoap on Twitter, and AOAP from now on) is a 2-day course. The focus is on understanding the higher-level constructs of Agile and how they imbricate. In the course, one learns how the ideal Agile team is composed (hint: it&#39;s cross-functional and co-located) and what practices and techniques will be used to organize at all levels, from the developers&#39; standup to the customers&#39; research for the next best value-delivering feature, including how to properly create a feature that developers can work on and how to best break it down into stories (and then into tasks).</description>

      <description>Here is a thought with which I&#39;ve been wrestling for quite a while - the focus of society on knowledge and what it could be doing to us as people, human beings, and members of society, as well as to society itself. Knowledge is power - knowing more can only help you In the West (bounded to the east by Russia and to the west by the Americas), the focus has historically been on developing more knowledge, more science.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve been using git at work for a greenfield project and, so far, this has worked for us. It could be a useful template to get another team started. We have gotten rid of the name &#39;master&#39;, which is only a convention anyway, and instead are using a few permanent branches:  production (only stable code which gets deployed to production goes there. The only branch to be merged in, EVER, is &#39;stable&#39;) stable (only stable code which goes to the staging environment goes there.</description>

      <description>I flew overnight from Vancouver to be with you today. I landed in New York a few hours ago and caught a flight down here because I needed to tell you all in person that I think you’re awesome. I was raised by a teacher. My mother is a professor of early childhood education. And from the time I went to kindergarten through my senior year in high school, I went to public schools.</description>

      <description>First, get Ruby. Install it as explained on the website. Once you&#39;re more comfortable with it, in a few weeks, you can check out RVM. Not now though - you&#39;d just confuse yourself.
The two important command-line tools are going to be &#34;irb&#34; and &#34;ruby&#34;. For development, you will be able to use tools like emacs, vim, Jetbrains Rubymine, or Eclipse. Ruby support is quite widespread.
Create a temporary directory and get cozy inside.</description>

      <description>The Master had been clear on this point - the room was treated so the five physical senses would be useless. When Scott asked how, the Master laughed and told him it was magic. Scott had chuckled and shaken his head. Clearly, no point in arguing - not today&#39;s knowledge.
Scott blinked and the test began. He relaxed and extended his consciousness into the ground below him and around him. He knew his limit well: no more than a five-foot radius around him.</description>

At the time of this writing, If you have a Poulsbo video card (another craptastic Intel invention) do not upgrade to xorg-server 1.7. Stay on 1.6.5-r1 or whatever you have. If you upgrade, xorg will just refuse to work for you, and downgrading is kind of a pain.
If you have upgraded already, then here&#39;s what to do:</description>

Thankfully, I&#39;ve got tons of subway time now, so I can practice standing. For those of you who don&#39;t study martial arts... That last sentence is not a joke.</description>

I&#39;m switching from Systems Administration / Tech Support / Hell desk (not a typo, sadly) to Development / Programming.
I am very much looking forward to it. It means a hobby/job switch: I will now do sysadmin stuff as a hobby, and programming as a full-time job.</description>

      <description>Hooks are a fascinating bit of Ruby magic. They are methods you can define with actions to run when something happens. You can put triggers in your code.
This blog post explains them very well; and for more information, get &#34;Metaprogramming Ruby&#34;, which is a great book - not only about the callbacks, but about a host of information.</description>

Here is a summary of what I had to do, besides the calisthenics:  All my empty-hand forms, opposite side. There are eight of them. This meant that if the first step was with the left foot, I had to do it with the right foot. I suppose you could also call that &#39;mirror&#39;. The names are : seisan, seiuchin, naihanchi, wonsu, chinto, kusanku, sunsu, and sanchin.</description>

I read about a git feature called &#34;smart HTTP&#34;, which would allow to communicate both ways with git (push and pull) with HTTP or HTTPS. So, I asked Github about it - it would be nice for them to have this feature, because I currently can&#39;t push to Github from work.</description>

Let me know if you have questions or doubts.&#34; When we had finished walking through it, I looked at the clock.</description>

      <description>There are a few gotchas: 1) If you have a SSD drive, you need to modprobe pata_sch to see it. 2) when using GRUB, install it on whatever drive the hard drive is, even if it&#39;s /dev/sdc -- and let your FSTAB use /dev/sda. Chances are that /dev/sda is your liveUSB. 3) In the kernel, in the I2C options, don&#39;t let it pick automatically - instead, select the algorithm options in the menu that appears (I don&#39;t know it off-hand, will edit this post later to add the important information).</description>

      <description>One can&#39;t actually move a remote branch, but you can copy a branch and delete a branch, so...
Copy oldbranch in repo to newbranch.
git push {repo} {oldbranch}:heads/{newbranch}  Ex: git push origin foobranch:barbranch renames foobranch to barbranch
Remove a remote branch: it’s all about the colon:
git push &amp;lt;remote_repo&amp;gt; :heads/&amp;lt;branch&amp;gt;  [code][/code]
Example: git push origin :heads/some-branch removes some-branch from the remote repo (apparently git push origin :some-branch works as well).</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t really have a better name for this. It&#39;s also not completely clean, but it works. I had, almost a year ago (362 days ago), written a blog post about lexicographic permutations. That was about permutations of elements within one array. Someone on ruby-forum asked about permutations between multiple arrays. I found something in C#, which I was happy to transcribe to Ruby and tweak a little.
def array_permutations array, index=0 # index is 0 by default : start at the beginning, more elegant.</description>

def cnh # silly name &amp;amp;quot;create nested hash&amp;amp;quot; Hash.new {|h,k| h[k] = Hash.new(&amp;amp;amp;h.default_proc)} end my_hash = cnh my_hash[1][2][3] = 4 my_hash # =&amp;amp;gt; { 1 =&amp;amp;gt; { 2 =&amp;amp;gt; { 3 =&amp;amp;gt;4 } } }  This is useful because it reduces the amount of logic in the code.

They&#39;re not particularly hidden, but I never really noticed them before. This started to make me think about my choices.  My lasting decision to study martial arts was made in college, and I took a Physical Education class of self-defense taught by shifu Christopher Goedecke, who studies and teaches isshin kempo.</description>

      <description>It was surprisingly good. I didn&#39;t feel very good tonight - slight headache, slight tingle in the throat. I wasn&#39;t going to stay for my class, just help teach and then go home, get tea, get sleep.. But only two other adults showed up and sensei was upstairs, so I started the class and took it easy on the calisthenics and the stretches. Those two adults are the two with the most issues of muscle contractions (as in, they have no idea what relaxing means).</description>

      <description>I had a good time in the dojo tonight. Managed to bring a kid back from the verge of tears to feeling good and performing kata with solid focus and intent.. And then good sparring. Kid&#39;s 6, by the way. My class wasn&#39;t that good, though I got a compliment on my push-ups from sensei. Went through my kicks.. Then sparred..
I fleetingly get a grasp of efficient body movement, and then it disappears, and then I have to train a lot more to make it happen again, and then more again, etc etc, until I can make it happen effortlessly.</description>

      <title>Rails, HAML, alternatible CSS for tables</title>
      <link>http://blog.trevoke.net/post/import-rails-haml-alternatible-css-for-tables-publish/</link>

      <description>If you&#39;ve done any kind of table display in Rails, you&#39;ve probably discovered the useful &#39;cycle&#39; method:
&#34;
This works after you&#39;ve set two CSS classes between which you want to alternate - in my example, even and odd, because I have such amazing imagination. Come to think of it, to make my code more readable, it should be &#39;lightbg&#39; and &#39;darkbg&#39;, or something similar. I&#39;ll fix that.
But yeah - how do you do that in HAML?</description>

      <description>I live on an island. It only took me until last week (10 years and change) to take my dad&#39;s advice to go to the beach when I felt like it. So I did that, last week and today, and went swimming. Good for the muscles, good all-around body work. Great stretching. Different way of using the muscles.
Besides the fact that I could really only swim for 10-15 minutes before I was tired and a part of my arms started to ache (indicating, clearly, that I&#39;d been ignoring it), I noticed on my way home that even just 30 minutes at the beach drained me of energy.</description>

      <description>Those two videos have been brought to my attention within maybe two weeks of each other, and I hate thinking of random coincidences.. So here they are, together so I can find them again in several years. Playing for change: Stand by me Where the hell is Matt?
The first one fills my heart with a warm feeling - the song was recorded by all these people around the world simultaneously (or so they say, but it sure is well edited in any case).</description>

      <description>In the past couple of weeks, I&#39;d gotten to spar progressively harder with a blue belt who is twice my age, but has been in dojos where sparring and self-defense were more important than kata. As a result, I consider him somewhat dangerous to spar with.. And, well, I let myself get caught up. I stopped being the watcher.. I hid behind the excuse that I was just sparring as hard as he wanted to spar, and so it just escalated.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine wrote about shoulder relaxation.. Apparently we both had the same mental block, but he solved it first - shoulder relaxation (and by extension, all relaxation) can be done up/down and ... forward/back!
At first I didn&#39;t think I had that issue, my western mind automatically went &#34;Nah, I don&#39;t have that issue, my shoulders are nice and straight!&#34; .. And then training kicked in and the answer came : &#34;</description>

      <description>So, I&#39;ve been trying to keep my stances down a lot more now - it&#39;s making me much more aware of when I get tense.. Because I rise, because my ankles, hips and knees just don&#39;t flex. It&#39;s an interesting experience. Two people are testing.. During sparring, that evening was the first time that I made a conscious point of &#34;the first thing I do is move - and then answer&#34;</description>

dirs = [] Dir[&#39;*&#39;].each do |item| if File.directory?(item) if dirs.empty? dirs &amp;lt;&amp;lt; [item] next end inserted = false dirs.each_with_index do |list_of_folders, index| if list_of_folders[0].</description>

I&#39;ve been getting used to being shodan, which maybe is a bad thing, but I haven&#39;t stopped looking for things I could do better. I&#39;m becoming more sensitive to the muscles in my back, and I think my shoulders are finally beginning to open up...
So, I have something like 5 months to prepare.. Or, you know, whenever it turns out sensei thinks I&#39;m ready.</description>

      <description>Taking the code from this other blog ... It&#39;s pretty elegant Ruby!
I won&#39;t waste your time repeating what the guy wrote in his blog - you&#39;re welcome to go read it. I just felt that I should help spread a little this elegant implementation of the standard permutation algorithm, fixing a small bug within it in the process. If, like me, you have issues understanding how to use this, well - you have to use this function and call a block of code on it.</description>

Their heads are full of them. Can&#39;t they just listen and say &#39;yes&#39; like they were taught when they were kids? Talking back is a privilege, not a right. Ooh.. That&#39;s good..

 Assume in this example that the username is &#39;atiensivu&#39;, the domain is &#39;staff&#39;, and the user profile is located in %systemdrive%\users\atiensivu. %systemdrive% is typically C: on standard Vista installs. Replace every instance &#39;atiensivu&#39; with the username of the corrupt profile.  If you can log into the profile, make note of the %USERPROFILE% environment variable value.</description>

      <description>Yesterday evening a man who trained about as long as sensei came to train with us. Black obi, rather frayed to white. He&#39;d trained a long time under his uncle, and then ~15 years under sensei&#39;s sensei. He&#39;d taken a break for a while, so he was a bit out of shape, but his mindset, his attitude, his devotion were 100% into everything he did - an important lesson which I forget all too often.</description>

      <description>Whoo! I haven&#39;t done a post that long in a while!
I put &#39;activerecord&#39; in there to take advantage of the &#39;24.hours.ago&#39; notation, which makes life much easier. The cost is a little less than 2 seconds to load the library, so I think it&#39;s worth it. It runs as a daily job before backup to tape, to clear old backups from the directory tree.

By default, the folder C:\Program Files\MIM\config should make you really happy, it&#39;s got lots of plain text files with configuration for all kinds of settings.
cleanup.txt has &#34;ARCHIVE LEFTOVER AGE (DAYS) := 60
Change that to whatever you feel is appropriate for you needs.</description>

We did some kali stick work. The yellow and blue belt had never seen those drills before so we started with a simple high-low-high, but we did try for a little bit the sinawali drills, specifically heaven, because that one&#39;s fun :) Kali sticks are very good to work follow-through, speed and flow, and god knows I need that.</description>

      <description>Monday and yesterday, two blue belts were to test for purple. They went through their calisthenics and basics; I did not see their forms on Monday, but I did see them on Wednesday. They were bad enough sensei wanted to see them again, that much I understood, but not sure how bad until I saw them both.
Neither of them broke a sweat until fighting, not for the 100 jumping jacks, not for the 60 push-ups, not for the multiple kick combinations.</description>

      <description>Is it a worrying trend that I write mostly about pain in here? :)
Every once in a while, usually while doing a high block with my left arm, I&#39;d feel a pain in my left shoulder. It felt like a part was rolling over another one.. Muscle over bone, or something like that. It&#39;s not pleasant and is the kind of pain that stops your movement quite short and quite abruptly.</description>

Think of a line going horizontally across the middle of the back (under the shoulderblades), and you have it. I didn&#39;t stay for weapons past my bo class and went home. I was OK during my sword class, which means either I wasn&#39;t paying attention, or I wasn&#39;t using those muscles.</description>

      <description>We have a move in a form that requires holding a hand in front of the solar plexus. One of the kids was holding his hand a little low, so I mentioned it to him.. He start hitting his chest a few times with his hand, so I laugh. &#34;Think you got it?&#34; He does it a few more times and starts coughing. &#34;Ah, now you got it.&#34;</description>

      <description>Sparring can be one of the many reasons one wants to join a martial arts school, sometimes even their only interest. Unless you join a school based on street defense, you may not do as much as you&#39;d like. Besides, the insurances and legality issues being what they are, usually you are limited to sparring gear which lets you mostly throw punches and kicks.
The teacher of a traditional school probably won&#39;t let you spar until after you get a belt or two, because you need to break in your body and the techniques you are learning -- besides, you don&#39;t have enough control to know when to stop your strikes, so if your opponent fails to block, you could hurt him quite a bit.</description>

      <description>So, you&#39;ve decided to start taking a martial arts class. Good for you!
Why do you want to join? Is it to fight, to learn to defend yourself, to develop self-discipline, to learn kata (&#39;forms&#39;), for health reasons? All of the above?
For the purpose of this article (if nothing else), I will make a differentiation between a fighting style and a martial art. In a fighting style, you are learning to fight, and that is it.</description>
