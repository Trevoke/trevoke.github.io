    <div class="content">
      <p>I don't know how I did it, but at some point during my empty hand class, I hurt my back. Think of a line going horizontally across the middle of the back (under the shoulderblades), and you have it. I didn't stay for weapons past my bo class and went home. I was OK during my sword class, which means either I wasn't paying attention, or I wasn't using those muscles..</p>

<p>It got worse in the evening, to the point where I was walking slowly, and I couldn't help but play with it a little -- forced to use momentum generated by other muscles in order not to feel pain. Sunday was better but still careful, and Monday I considered not going to work but I felt good enough not to let it stop me. Training on Monday night made it pretty much all go away.</p>

<p>It's very interesting to be in pain, when it's not constant and excruciating (because that just sucks), you can explore better your body's workings.</p>
