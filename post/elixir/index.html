    <h1 class="title">      Why Elixir is the next Great Tech</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <h1 id="elixir-because">Elixir, because:</h1>

<p>I think of Elixir as an idea whose time has come; or rather, a great gathering of ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Erlang has solved the problem of distributed computing (and therefore, of concurrency) decades ago, and now concurrency is a very desirable tool, as the amount of data we crunch regularly has increased exponentially.</li>
<li>TDD has brought a more functional approach to a lot code, and that is the paradigm Elixir espouses.</li>
<li>Elixir takes all of the syntax niceness from Ruby, so it's pretty and easy to read.</li>
<li>Elixir makes OTP incredibly convenient to use, which means that one is able to create and communicate with processes with concise and expressive code.</li>
<li>Elixir's Phoenix Framework makes both stateless (traditional request/response) and stateful (anything from long-polling to websockets) connections very simple to use, by providing powerful abstractions based on OTP. The code remains readable.</li>
<li>The websocket connections are easy to set up and easy to scale, maintaining a single state via the socket: a tempting idea for folks using the Flux architecture in the front-end.</li>
<li>Elixir's Phoenix Framework takes from all the lessons of Rails and Javascript of the past decade and has created a testable, maintainable, and extendable web MVC framework that in reality, is just another OTP application.</li>
<li>As we depend more and more on external services (API, either internal or external), fault tolerance becomes top-of-mind when building robust systems. This is another problem Erlang solved years ago through supervisors and managing how to handle failures.</li>
<li>Elixir/OTP allows for incredible uptime by letting you write code in such a way you can actually do hot reloading.</li>
<li>Elixir is one of the few non-lisp languages to implement real macros. This allows you to create your own domain language in your code should you need it.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we move more towards microservices, and given that a microservice is the unit of thought in Elixir (an OTP app is just a service that can receive messages, send messages, and hold state), it will become a de-facto choice, because it is a superior abstraction to the existing options.</p>

<p>Elixir and Phoenix are the new present. Bow to our new tech stack overlord.</p>
